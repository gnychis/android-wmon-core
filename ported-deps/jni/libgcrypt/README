    Overview
    --------

    Libgcrypt is a general purpose crypto library based on the code
    used in GnuPG.  Libgcrypt depends on the library `libgpg-error',
    which must be installed correctly before Libgcrypt is to be built.
    Libgcrypt is distributed under the LGPL, see the section "License"
    below for details.


    Build Instructions
    ------------------

    The download canonical location for libgcrypt is:

      ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/
     
    To build libgcrypt you need libgpg-error:

      ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgpg-error/

    You should get the latest versions of course.

    After building and installing the libgpg-error package, you may
    continue with Libgcrypt installation As with allmost all GNU
    packages, you just have to do

       ./configure
       make
       make check
       make install

    The "make check" is not required but a good idea to see whether
    the library works as expected.  The check takes some while and
    prints some benchmarking results.  Before doing "make install" you
    probably need to become root.

    To build libgcrypt for Microsoft Windows, you need to have the
    mingw32 cross-building toolchain installed.  Instead of running a
    plain configure you use

      ./autogen.sh --build-w32
      make
      make install
      
    By default this command sequences expectsd a libgpg-error
    installed below $HOME/w32root and installs libgcrypt to that
    directory too.  See the autogen.sh code for details.

    The documentation is available as an Info file (gcrypt.info).  To
    build documentation in PDF, run this:

      cd doc
      make pdf



    Mailing List
    ------------

    You may want to join the developer's mailing list
    gcrypt-devel@gnupg.org by sending mail with a subject of
    "subscribe" to gcrypt-devel-request@gnupg.org.  An archive of this
    list is available at http://lists.gnupg.org .


    Configure options 
    -----------------
    Here is a list of configure options which are sometimes useful 
    for installation.

     --enable-m-guard
                     Enable the integrated malloc checking code. Please
                     note that this feature does not work on all CPUs
                     (e.g. SunOS 5.7 on UltraSparc-2) and might give
                     you a bus error.

     --disable-asm
                     Do not use assembler modules.  It is not possible 
                     to use this on some CPU types.
                    
     --enable-ld-version-script
                     Libgcrypt tries to build a library where internal
                     symbols are not exported.  This requires support
                     from ld and is currently enabled for a few OSes.
                     If you know that your ld supports the so called
                     ELF version scripts, you can use this option to
                     force its use.  OTOH, if you get error message
                     from the linker, you probably want to use this
                     option to disable the use of version scripts.
                     Note, that you should never ever use an
                     undocumented symbol or one which is prefixed with
                     an underscore. 

     --enable-ciphers=list
     --enable-pubkey-ciphers=list
     --enable-digests=list
                     If not otherwise specified, all algorithms
                     included in the libgcrypt source tree are built.
		     An exception are algorithms, which depend on
		     features not provided by the system, like 64bit
		     data types.  With these switches it is possible
                     to select exactly those algorithm modules, which
		     should be built.  The algorithms are to be
                     separated by spaces, commas or colons.  To view
                     the list used with the current build the program
                     tests/version may be used.

     --disable-endian-check
                     Don't let configure test for the endianness but
                     try to use the OS provided macros at compile
                     time.  This is helpful to create OS X fat binaries.

     --enable-random-daemon
                     Include support for a global random damon and
                     build the daemon.  This is an experimental feature.

     --enable-mpi-path=EXTRA_PATH
                     Prepend EXTRA_PATH to list of CPU specific
                     optimizations.  For example, if you want to add
                     optimizations forn a Intel Pentium 4 compatible
                     CPU, you may use
                        --enable-mpi-path=pentium4/sse2:pentium4/mmx
                     Take care: The generated library may crash on
                     non-compatible CPUs.

     --enable-random=NAME 
                     Force the use of the random gathering module
		     NAME.  Default is either to use /dev/random or
		     the auto mode.  Possible values for NAME are:
		       egd - Use the module which accesses the
			     Entropy Gathering Daemon. See the webpages
			     for more information about it.
		      unix - Use the standard Unix module which does not
			     have a very good performance.
		     linux - Use the module which accesses /dev/random.
			     This is the first choice and the default one
			     for GNU/Linux or *BSD.
                      auto - Compile linux, egd and unix in and 
                             automagically select at runtime.
  
     --enable-hmac-binary-check
                     Include support to check the binary at runtime
                     against a HMAC checksum.  This works only in FIPS
                     mode and on systems providing the dladdr function.

     --disable-padlock-support
                     Disable support for the PadLock engine of VIA
                     processors.  The default is to use PadLock if
                     available.  Try this if you get problems with
                     assembler code.

       


    License
    -------
    
    The library is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser
    General Public License (LGPL); see the file COPYING.LIB for the
    actual terms.  The helper programs (e.g. gcryptrnd and getrandom)
    as well as the documentation are distributed under the terms of
    the GNU General Public License (GPL); see the file COPYING for the
    actual terms.

    This library used to be available under the GPL - this was changed
    with version 1.1.7 with the rationale that there are now many free
    crypto libraries available and many of them come with capabilities
    similar to Libcrypt.  We decided that to foster the use of
    cryptography in Free Software an LGPLed library would make more
    sense because it avoids problems due to license incompatibilities
    between some Free Software licenses and the GPL.

    Please note that in many cases it is better for a library to be
    licensed under the GPL, so that it provides an advantage for free
    software projects.  The Lesser GPL is so named because it does
    less to protect the freedom of the users of the code that it
    covers.  See http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html for
    more explanation.
