  <para>
	This book tries to give you a guide to start your own experiments into 
	the wonderful world of Wireshark development.
  </para>
  <para>
	Developers who are new to Wireshark often have a hard time getting 
	their development environment up and running. This is
	especially true for Win32 developers, as a lot of the tools and methods
	used when building Wireshark are much more common in the UNIX world than
	on Win32.
  </para>
  <para>
	The first part of this book will describe how to set up the environment 
	needed to develop Wireshark.
  </para>
  <para>
	The second part of this book will describe how to change the Wireshark 
	source code.
  </para>
  <para>
    We hope that you find this book useful, and look forward to your comments.
