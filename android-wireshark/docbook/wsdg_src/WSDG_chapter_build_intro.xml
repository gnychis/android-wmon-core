	<para>
	Currently there's no clean separation of the modules in the code. 
	However, as the development team switched from Concurrent Versions System
	(CVS) to Subversion (SVN) some time ago,
	directory cleanup is much easier now. So there's a chance that
	the directory structure will become clean in the future.
