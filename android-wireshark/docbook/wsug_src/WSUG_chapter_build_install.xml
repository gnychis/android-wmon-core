      As with all things, there must be a beginning, and so it is with 
      Wireshark. To use Wireshark, you must:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Obtain a binary package for your operating system, or

    </para>
    <para>
      Currently, several Linux distributions ship Wireshark, but
      they are commonly shipping an out-of-date version.  No other versions 
      of UNIX ship Wireshark so far, and Microsoft does not ship it with any 
      version of Windows.  For that reason, you will need to know where to 
      get the latest version of Wireshark and how to install it.
    </para>
    <para>
      This chapter shows you how to obtain source and binary packages, 
      and how to build Wireshark from source, should you choose to do so.
    </para>
    <para>
      The following are the general steps you would use:
      <orderedlist>

	    Download the relevant package for your needs, e.g. source or 
	    binary distribution.
	  </para>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Build the source into a binary, if you have downloaded the 
	    source.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    This may involve building and/or installing other necessary packages.

    <title>Obtaining the source and binary distributions</title>
    <para>
      You can obtain both source and binary distributions from the Wireshark 
      web site: <ulink url="&WiresharkWebSite;">&WiresharkWebSite;</ulink>. 
      Simply select the download link, and then select either the source 
      package or binary package of your choice from the mirror site closest 
      to you.
    </para>
    <note>
      <title>Download all required files!</title>
      <para>
	In general, unless you have already downloaded Wireshark 
	before, you will most likely need to download several source 
	packages if you are building Wireshark from source.  This is 
	covered in more detail below. <!-- Make a ref -->
      </para>
    </note>
    <para>
      Once you have downloaded the relevant files, you can go on to the 
      next step.

    <note>
      <title>Note!</title>
      <para>
	While you will find a number of binary packages available on the 
	Wireshark web site, you might not find one for your platform, and 
	they often tend to be several versions behind the current released 
	version, as they are contributed by people who have the platforms 
	they are built for.
      </para>
      <para>
	For this reason, you might want to pull down the source distribution 
	and build it, as the process is relatively simple.

    <title>Before you build <application>Wireshark</application> under UNIX</title>
    <para>
      Before you build Wireshark from sources, or install a binary package, 
      you must ensure that you have the following other packages installed:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>GTK+, The GIMP Tool Kit.</para>
	  <para>
	    You will also need Glib.  Both can be obtained from

	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    libpcap, the packet capture software that Wireshark uses.
	  </para>

	    <ulink url="&TcpdumpWebsite;">www.tcpdump.org</ulink>
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      Depending on your system, you may be able to install these from 
      binaries, e.g. RPMs, or you may need to obtain them in source code 
      form and build them.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you have downloaded the source for GTK+, the instructions shown 
      in <xref linkend="Ch02Ex1"/> may provide some help in building it:

	    You may need to change the version number of GTK+ in

	      downloaded. The directory you change to will change if the

      If you have downloaded the source to libpcap, the general instructions

      Under Red Hat 6.x and beyond (and distributions based on it, like 
      Mandrake) you can simply install each of the packages you need from 
      RPMs. Most Linux systems will install GTK+ and GLib in any case, 
      however you will probably need to install the devel versions of 
      each of these packages. The commands shown in <xref linkend="Ch02Ex4"/> 
	will install all the needed RPMs if they are not already installed.

      In general, installing the binary under your version of UNIX will be 
      specific to the installation methods used with your version of UNIX.  
      For example, under AIX, you would use <command>smit</command> to 
      install the Wireshark binary package, while under Tru64 UNIX 
      (formerly Digital UNIX) you would use <command>setld</command>.

    <title>Troubleshooting during the install on Unix</title>
    <para>
      A number of errors can occur during the installation process.  
      Some hints on solving these are provided here.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the <command>configure</command> stage fails, you will need to find 
      out why. You can check the file <filename>config.log</filename> in the 
      source directory to find out what failed. The last few lines of this 
      file should help in determining the problem.
    </para>
    <para>
      The standard problems are that you do not have GTK+ on your system, 
      or you do not have a recent enough version of GTK+. The 
      <command>configure</command> will also fail if you do not have libpcap 
      (at least the required include files) on your system.
    </para>
    <para>
      Another common problem is for the final compile and link stage to 
      terminate with a complaint of: <errorname>Output too long.</errorname>  
      This is likely to be caused by an antiquated <command>sed</command> 
      (such as the one shipped with Solaris).  Since <command>sed</command> is 
      used by the <command>libtool</command> script to construct the final 
      link command, this leads to mysterious problems.  This can be 
      resolved by downloading a recent version of sed from 
      <ulink url="http://directory.fsf.org/project/sed/"/>.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you cannot determine what the problems are, send an email to the 
      <command>wireshark-dev</command> mailing list explaining your problem, 
      and including the output from <filename>config.log</filename> and 
      anything else you think is relevant, like a trace of the 
      <command>make</command> stage.

    <para>
	The following is only necessary if you want to 
	try a different version than the one included in the Wireshark installer, 
	e.g. because a new WinPcap (beta) version was released.
    </para>
    <para>
	Additional WinPcap versions (including newer alpha or beta releases)
	can be downloaded from the following locations:
	<itemizedlist>

  <section id="ChBuildInstallWinWiresharkUpdate">
    <title>Update Wireshark</title>
	<para>
	From time to time you may want to update your installed Wireshark to a more
	recent version. If you join Wireshark's announce mailing list, you will be 
	informed about new Wireshark versions, see <xref 
	linkend="ChIntroMailingLists"/> for details how to subscribe to this list.
    </para>
    <para>
	New versions of Wireshark usually become available every 4 to 8 months.
	Updating Wireshark is done the same way as installing it, you simply 
	download and start the installer exe. A reboot is usually not required and
	all your personal settings remain unchanged.
    </para>
  </section>
  
  <section id="ChBuildInstallWinPcapUpdate">
    <title>Update WinPcap</title>
    <para>
	New versions of WinPcap are less frequently available, maybe only once in a 
	year. You will find WinPcap update instructions where you can download new 
	WinPcap versions. Usually you have to reboot the machine after installing 
	a new WinPcap version.
    </para>
	<warning><title>Warning!</title>
	<para>
	If you have an older version of WinPcap installed, you must uninstall it 
	before installing the current version. Recent versions of the WinPcap 
	installer will take care of this.

	Programs" option inside the Control Panel. Select the "Wireshark" entry to 
	start the uninstallation procedure.
    </para>

	The Wireshark uninstaller will provide several options as to which things are to be
