  <para>
    Wireshark is one of those programs that many network managers would love 
    to be able to use, but they are often prevented from getting what they 
    would like from Wireshark because of the lack of documentation.
  </para>
  <para>
    This document is part of an effort by the Wireshark team to improve the 
	usability of Wireshark.
  </para>
  <para>
    We hope that you find it useful, and look forward to your comments.

  <section id="PreAudience">
  <title>Who should read this document?</title>
  <para>
  The intended audience of this book is anyone using Wireshark.
  </para>
  <para>
  This book will explain all the basics and also some of the advanced features 
  that Wireshark provides. As Wireshark has become a very complex program since 
  the early days, not every feature of Wireshark may be explained in this 
  book. 
  </para>
  <para>
  This book is not intended to explain network sniffing in general and it will
  not provide details about specific network protocols. A lot of useful 
  information regarding these topics can be found at the Wireshark Wiki at
  <ulink url="&WiresharkWikiPage;">&WiresharkWikiPage;</ulink>
  </para>
  <para>
  By reading this book, you will learn how to install Wireshark, how to use the 
  basic elements of the graphical user interface (such as the menu) and what's 
  behind some of the advanced features that are not always obvious at first 
  sight. It will hopefully guide you around some common problems that
  frequently appear for new (and sometimes even advanced) users of Wireshark.
