 * This function should be as lightweight as possible since it executes
 * together with the normal wireshark dissectors.  Try to push as much
 * processing as possible into (*draw) instead since that function executes
 * asynchronously and does not affect the main thread's performance.

 * If it is possible, try to do all "filtering" explicitly since you will get
 * MUCH better performance than applying a similar display-filter in the

 * -> Windows ping output:

 *      Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
 *          Minimum = <m>ms, Maximum = <M>ms, Average = <A>ms
 *
 * -> Cygwin ping output:
 *      ----<HOST> PING Statistics----
 *      <S> packets transmitted, <R> packets received, <LP>% packet loss
 *      round-trip (ms)  min/avg/max/med = <m>/<M>/<A>/<D>
 *
 * -> Linux ping output:
 *      --- <HOST> ping statistics ---

 *      rtt min/avg/max/mdev = <m>/<A>/<M>/<D> ms
